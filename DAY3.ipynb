    "Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and modified efficiently. Data structures can vary in terms of their characteristics, such as linear or non-linear, homogeneous or heterogeneous, static or dynamic, etc. Some of the common data structures are arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc. Data structures are used for various purposes, such as storing data, managing resources and services, implementing algorithms, and solving problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of real-world applications of data structures are:\n",
    " Arrays: Arrays are used for storing multiple elements of the same type in a contiguous memory location. Arrays are useful for implementing matrices, lookup tables, image processing, etc.\n",
    " \n",
    "Linked lists: Linked lists are used for storing elements that are linked by pointers. Linked lists are useful for implementing dynamic data structures, such as stacks, queues, trees, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacks: Stacks are used for storing elements in a last-in first-out (LIFO) order. Stacks are useful for implementing recursion, backtracking, expression evaluation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queues: Queues are used for storing elements in a first-in first-out (FIFO) order. Queues are useful for implementing scheduling algorithms, buffering, simulation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees: Trees are used for storing hierarchical data that have a parent-child relationship. Trees are useful for implementing file systems, databases, XML parsing, decision making, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs: Graphs are used for storing data that have a network structure with nodes and edges. Graphs are useful for implementing social networks, maps, routing algorithms, artificial intelligence, etc.\n",
